just like I eventually got to actually making my website,
I will one day eventually get to writing an actual blog post, InshAllah.

for now enjoy these 'hello, world!' examples:

# Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("hello, world!")
}
```

# TypeScript

```ts
console.log("hello, world!");
```

# Python

```py
print("hello, world!")
```

# Rust

```rs
fn main() {
  println!("hello, world!");
}
```
