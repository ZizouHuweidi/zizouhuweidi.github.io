just like I eventually got to actually making my website,
I will one day eventually get to writing an actual blog post InshAllah.

For now enjoy these 'hello, world!' examples in my languages of choice.

# Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("hello, world!")
}
```

# Python

```py
print("hello, world!")
```

# TypeScript

```ts
console.log("hello, world!");
```
