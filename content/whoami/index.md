# whoami

Muslim, Libyan, Software Engineer.

I value simplicity in everything, which is why I strive to understand things deeply to achieve simplicity without sacrificing correctness, efficiency or practicality

The goal is to be a key to goodness and leave behind a legacy of goodness.

# interests

Backend Engineer interested in System Design and Distributed Systems.

# tech

I like technology that gets out of your way as much as possible and helps you focus on the task you want to solve

Here are some technologies that I use regularly:

- Go {{<icon "go">}}
- Postgres {{<icon "postgres">}}
- gRPC {{<icon "grpc">}}
- RabbitMQ {{<icon "rabbitmq">}}
- Docker {{<icon "docker">}}
